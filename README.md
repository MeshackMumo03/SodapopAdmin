# SodapopAdmin
Project Overview
This project involves developing a distributed Android application to automate the operations of a business enterprise that sells drinks from various brands. The application allows administraters to moniter any branch, including the headquarters, and ensures that these orders are sent efficiently.

Key Features
Customer Order Management:

Customers can place orders at any branch, including the headquarter store.
Orders are processed and tracked within the system.
Branch-Specific Reporting:

The system generates detailed reports on the orders, including:
The customers who placed the orders.
The branch(es) where the orders were made.
The revenue generated from sales at each branch.
Comprehensive Sales Reporting:

The application produces a final report that reflects the total revenue generated across all branches.
Stock Level Monitoring:

The system issues alerts whenever stock levels fall below a predefined minimum threshold, ensuring timely restocking and uninterrupted service.
Architecture
The application is designed as a distributed system, with multiple branches operating under a central headquarters, each capable of processing and managing orders independently while maintaining synchronization with the central system.

Objectives
Automate and streamline the ordering process for customers.
Enable efficient order processing and tracking across multiple branches.
Provide detailed and comprehensive sales and customer reports.
Ensure proactive stock management with automated alerts for low inventory levels.
